# topoPowerMeter
Most power meters used in cycling use strain gauges on crank arm to register power. A power calcuation is then made directly. In the absence of a strain gauge for the novice cyclist, use topography to create power file. If topography of a route is known, then the power produced by the rider can be gauged with the riders weight and speed for a given point in a ride. This would be a significant cost savings to the novice rider. Topography could be mapped by riding a given route uses app that records elevation. Topography from unknown rides could be gathered from current social networking ride mapping sites like Strava, and Map My Ride.
